This assignment focuses on writing a collection of functions to simplify boolean expressions, reducing all tautologies to true, constradictions to false, and all other formulas to simple form. These functional manipulate two different abstract syntaxes for boolean expressions: (i) a rich general syntax called BoolExp and (ii) a restricted syntax called
IfExp that only uses one constructor called make-If (corresponding to a Racket struct named If).  A boolean expressions represented as an IfExp is easy to simplify.
The details of the assignment are given in the PDF file HW04.pdf.
