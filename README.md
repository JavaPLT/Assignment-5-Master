This assignment focuses on writing a collection of functions to simplify boolean expressions, reducing all tautologies to true, constradictions to false, and all other formulas to simple form. These functions manipulate two different abstract syntaxes for boolean expressions: (i) a rich general syntax called BoolExp and (ii) a restricted abstract syntax called
IfExp that only uses one constructor called make-If (corresponding to a Racket struct named If).  A boolean expression represented as an IfExp is easy to simplify.
